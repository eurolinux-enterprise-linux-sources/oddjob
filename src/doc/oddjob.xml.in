	<abstract>
	<para>
	The @DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_START@oddjob@DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_END@ package provides
	a means for unprivileged applications to invoke and take limited
	control of privileged applications by issuing requests using the
	@DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_START@D-Bus@DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_END@ system message bus.
	</para>
	</abstract>
	</articleinfo>

	<section>
	<title>Background</title>
	<para>
	In many applications, particularly those which perform some sort of
	administrative task, it becomes useful to separate the presentation
	(which needn't have any special privileges, and frequently shouldn't)
	from the logic which actually performs the task (which frequently
	needs privileges).
	</para>
	<para>
	In these situations, the unprivileged application typically
	accomplishes the privileged task either by running a setuid helper
	application or by connecting to a long-running process and issuing a
	request.
	</para>
	<para>
	Of the two options, the setuid helper approach offers the advantage of
	requiring less configuration beforehand, but can be undesirable in the
	context of libraries or demand-loaded modules, when the direct caller
	may be unaware of the state of the calling application with regard to
	signal handling, which must be taken into account if the caller
	expects to wait for the privileged child process to complete its task.
	Additionally, certain attributes of the unprivileged process which are
	inherited by the privileged helper (current directory, other open file
	handles, environment variables) may be manipulated to become vectors
	for attack by malicious users.
	</para>
	<para>
	The alternative, the use of a long-running process which services
	these requests, becomes attractive for these reasons.  The primary
	objections to this approach are frequently:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>that it adds yet another long-running
	resource-consuming process to the system</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>that the long-running process must be installed
	properly to ensure that it is started and stopped at system boot and
	shutdown</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>an entire protocol for encoding communications between
	the client and server must be invented</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>
	A third option has recently become available: the <ulink
	url="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fdbus"> <citetitle
	pubwork="webpage">@DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_START@D-Bus@DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_END@</citetitle></ulink>
	system message bus.  The system message bus provides an interprocess
	communication mechanism to processes on the system.  The bus carries
	three types of messages:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para><emphasis>events</emphasis>, which are broadcast and
	for which no response is expected</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para><emphasis>method calls</emphasis>, which are unicast
	and for which a response is usually expected</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para><emphasis>method responses</emphasis>, which are
	unicast and which are sent in response to a <emphasis>method
	call</emphasis></para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>
	Method call and response messages which are sent over the system
	message bus provide a loosely coupled object-oriented RPC mechanism.
	</para>
	<para>
	The @DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_START@D-Bus@DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_END@ libraries also
	provide a means of encoding, transmitting, listening for, receiving,
	and parsing messages which are sent over the bus.  Using
	@DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_START@D-Bus@DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_END@ as the mechanism for
	a long-running process reduces the time required to implement both a
	long-running server and its clients.  Because the implementation of the
	bus protocols is designed to be reused, it also offers the opportunity
	to have one privileged process service a potentially large number of
	clients.
	</para>
	<para>
	The @DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_START@oddjob@DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_END@ package
	implements such a server.
	</para>
	</section>

	<section>
	<title>oddjob</title>
	<para>
	The server provided by
	@DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_START@oddjob@DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_END@,
	<command>oddjobd</command>, provides services which appear to be
	indistinguishable from other services provided through
	@DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_START@D-Bus@DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_END@, but in an
	unconventional manner.  Before continuing, it is instructive to look at
	how clients and servers interact over the bus.
	</para>
	<para>
	The fundamental unit of communication over the system bus is the
	<emphasis>message</emphasis>.  For practical purposes, a message is
	composed of the addressing information which is needed to route that
	message to the proper recipient, and one of:
	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>information about the event being broadcast (the
	sender, additional information)</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>the method being called (the caller, the provider,
	method arguments)</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>the method being responded to (the caller, the
	provider, results)</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	</para>
	<para>
	More specifically, each message includes the address of its sender.
	Method call and response messages should also include the address of
	the intended recipient.  A bus address uniquely identifies a process
	which is connected to the message bus.  Generally, a single process
	will have exactly one open connection to the message bus.
	</para>
	<para>
	A message also includes an <emphasis>object path</emphasis>, which
	allows multiple client sessions to be serviced by the same server.
	Each object can provide multiple <emphasis>interface</emphasis>s,
	which are groups of related <emphasis>methods</emphasis>.
	</para>
	<para>
	The function of the <command>oddjobd</command> daemon is to allow
	arbitrary services to be provided over the message bus with a minimum
	of &quot;glue&quot;.  Services provided by
	<command>oddjobd</command> can be implemented very simply.  This
	simplicity of implementation is gained at the cost of some robustness,
	but for certain applications this is an acceptable tradeoff.
	</para>
	<para>
	An analogous comparison can be made between applications which are
	implemented on web servers using scripting engines and applications
	which are implemented using the Common Gateway Interface
	(<acronym>CGI</acronym>).
	</para>
	</section>

	<section>
	<title>An Example</title>
	<para>
	Take for example, a service which is provided by the well-known
	address &quot;com.example.system_manager&quot;.  This management service
	controls multiple systems, each of which is represented as a different
	object with a name of the form
	&quot;/com/example/Systems/server1&quot;.  Each
	object offers multiple interfaces, such as the
	&quot;<interface>com.example.power</interface>&quot; interface, which
	provides methods such as &quot;<methodname>reboot</methodname>&quot;
	and &quot;<methodname>poweroff</methodname>&quot;.
	</para>
	<para>
	Conventionally, the implementation of the
	&quot;com.example.system_manager&quot; service would require a
	long-running server process which would need to include logic for
	connecting to the system message bus, receiving requests, and issuing
	replies, in addition to its core functionality.
	</para>
	<para>
	Using <command>oddjobd</command>, the entire implementation can be
	synthesized by providing the proper configuration files and shell
	scripts.
	</para>

		Configuration</title>
		<para>
		The @DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_START@D-Bus@DOCBOOK_PACKAGE_END@ system
		bus enforces restrictions on which applications can reserve
		well-known bus addresses.  It bases this restriction on the UID
		under which a client process is executing when it requests the
		reservation.  Additionally, the system message bus can impose
		access controls on the ability to send or receive messages to
		or from a particular service/object/interface/method set using
		the bus.  This example allows processes running as
		&quot;root&quot; to reserve the name
		&quot;com.example.system_manager&quot;, and allows any user to
		call its <methodname>reboot</methodname> and
		<methodname>poweroff</methodname> methods.
		<tip><title>Tip</title><para>The message bus daemon itself has

	The <command>oddjobd</command> configuration is normally read from

	will direct the daemon to read all of the configuration files from

	<para>
	An <![CDATA[<include>]]> element names a file which should also be
