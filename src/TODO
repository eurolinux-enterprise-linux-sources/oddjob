- Auditing: learn how to report the calling process's "loginuid" attribute
  (requires help from the message bus daemon).
- Access control: support use of the "loginuid" in ACLs.
- Test cases:
  ACLs:
    UID range matching
    SELinux context matching
  Reloading
- mkhomedir: preserve ACLs
- Audit logging, if applicable.
