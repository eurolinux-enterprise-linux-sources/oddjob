.SH NAME
pam_oddjob_mkhomedir.so - PAM module to create users home directory via oddjob

.SH SYNOPSIS
session optional /lib/security/pam_oddjob_mkhomedir.so

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIpam_oddjob_mkhomedir.so\fR module checks if the user's home directory
exists, and if it does not, it invokes the \fImkhomedirfor\fR
method of the \fI@NAMESPACE@.oddjob_mkhomedir\fR service for the \fBPAM_USER\fR
if the module is running with superuser privileges.  Otherwise, it invokes the
\fImkmyhomedir\fR method.

The location of the skeleton directory and the default umask are determined by
the configuration for the corresponding service in \fBoddjobd-mkhomedir.conf\fR,
so they can not be specified as arguments to this module.

If \fID-Bus\fR has not been configured to allow the calling application to
invoke these methods provided as part of the \fI@NAMESPACE@.oddjob_mkhomedir\fR
interface of the \fI/\fR object provided by the
\fI@NAMESPACE@.oddjob_mkhomedir\fR service, then \fIoddjobd\fR will not receive
the request and an error will be returned by \fID-Bus\fR.

If \fIoddjobd\fR has not been configured to provide these methods, or the
user is not authorized to use them, then \fIoddjobd\fR will ignore the
module's requests.
