.SH NAME
oddjobd

.SH SYNOPSIS
oddjobd [-n] [-d] [-p pidfile] [-c configfile] [-S] [-t timeout]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIoddjobd\fR daemon provides the @NAMESPACE@.oddjob service on the
system-wide message bus.  Each facility which \fIoddjobd\fR provides is
provided as a separate D-Bus method.

Any method can be invoked by name by any user, subject to access controls
enforced by both D-Bus and \fIoddjobd\fR.

Most methods are implemented as helper programs.

.SH OPTIONS

-n
Do not fork and become a daemon process.

.TP
-S

.TP
-t timeout
Specifies the amount of time which will pass between attempts to reconnect to
the bus if oddjobd is disconnected for any reason.  If the specified timeout is
above @DEFAULT_FAST_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT@, then oddjobd will first attempt to
connect up to @DEFAULT_FAST_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS@ times at intervals of
@DEFAULT_FAST_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT@ seconds.  The default reconnect timeout is
@DEFAULT_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT@ seconds.

.SH SIGNALS
