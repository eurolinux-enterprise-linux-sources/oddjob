You'll need a fairly up to date system -- some of the build files are
generated, and the input used to generate them may be specific to
whichever version of the autotools I had installed on my box when I
committed the input files to git.

If everything's set up correctly, this is all you need to do:
    ./autogen
    make all dist
    rpmbuild -tb oddjob-*.tar.gz

If you're looking to add a new service/object/interface/method to the
list of those which can be invoked, create a new D-Bus config file under
/etc/dbus-1/system.d which allows users to issue requests to your
oddjobd-backed service (you'll need to restart D-Bus so that it will
read this file), and create an oddjobd configuration file under
/etc/oddjobd.conf.d to get oddjobd to accept those requests and to know
what to do with them (you'll need to restart or SIGHUP oddjobd so that it
will read the file).
