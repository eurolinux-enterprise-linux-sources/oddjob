	* src/launch.c: handle section headers with one of two capitalization
	styles.

2006-07-19 nalin
	* src/oddjob_dbus.c: don't explicitly subscribe to any messages.  This
	should stop the message bus daemon from trying to decide if we should
	see all of the messages which pass through, getting a "no" from the
	SELinux policy, and spamming the AVC log (#197256).
	* src/oddjob_dbus.c,src/oddjob_dbus.h: make oddjob_dbus_connection_close
	globally-callable, because D-Bus 0.90 doesn't provide _disconnect any
	more.
	* src/Makefile.am: pull the 'lookup' subdirectory out -- we don't
	actually use anything in there
